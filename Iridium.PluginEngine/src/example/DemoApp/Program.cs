            // library that will be referenced both by the original application
            // and any plugins built for that application.

            // a higher priority when retrieving them from the registry.
            // ComponentRegistry.Get<T> will fetch the most recently registered
            // implementation of a component type.

            // The plugin component implementation will be fully debuggable as long as
            // the source and debugging symbols are present in the IDE.
            // For example, if the source files for the plugin project are part of the solution
            // in Visual Studio, a developer will be able to step into this call and debug
            // the code in the component implementation
