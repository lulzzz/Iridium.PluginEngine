# Iridium.PluginEngine

Unified .NET Core Service Locator plugin system. A port of my Platinum.PluginEngine.

Iridium.PluginEngine makes it extremely easy to add an extensible plugin system to a .NET Core CLI or ASP.NET Core app.

## About

`Iridium.PluginEngine` is a complete port of my [Platinum.PluginEngine](https://github.com/0xFireball/Platinum.PluginEngine) library,
that allows you to use a service locator pattern with a framework that makes setup very easy.

A [full example](https://github.com/0xFireball/Iridium.PluginEngine/tree/master/Iridium.PluginEngine/src/example) is provided:
here is an excerpt of the main code complete with comments explaining everything:

```csharp
using DemoPlugins;
using DemoPlugins.Sdk;
using Iridium.PluginCore;
using Iridium.PluginEngine;
using Iridium.PluginEngine.Types;
using System.Reflection;

namespace DemoApp
{
    public class Program
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            // Create a new ComponentRegistry realm
            // Sets of plugins are specific to their registries
            var registry = new ComponentRegistry();
            // First, use the Platinum.PluginCore3 API to load component plugins
            // See the Platinum.PluginCore3 documentation for more information
            // Create a new PluginLoader that loads plugins that implement IPluginComponent
            // IPluginComponent is a special type of plugin that contains a component
            var plgLoader = new PluginLoader<IPlatinumComponent>();
            // In this example, we will load the plugin directly from the assembly
            // The PluginFactory<T> has other methods to load plugins from other locations, such as
            // files and directories
            var plugins = plgLoader.Factory.LoadPlugin(typeof(Dummy).GetTypeInfo().Assembly);

            // Register default implementation of components
            // This is an optional step, but these registered components will be used
            // in case no custom component implementations are loaded from the plugin
            // IConsole in this case is the interface of the component
            // Typically, the declaration of such interfaces should be in a Common or SDK
            // library that will be referenced both by the original application
            // and any plugins built for that application.
            // In this example, IConsole is declared in the DemoPlugin.SDK assembly
            registry.Register(new DefaultConsole(), typeof(IConsole));

            // Register components from plugins
            // PluginLoader<T>.RegisterAll() is an extension method that
            // will automatically find all components in all loaded plugins, and register
            // them in the global ComponentRegistry
            // In this example, all found implementations of IConsole will be registered as
            // IConsole components. The order of component registration is the same as the order the
            // plugin assemblies were loaded
            plgLoader.RegisterAll(registry);

            // Load components from registry
            // Since the default implementation was registered first,
            // any other implementations that were registered subsequently will have
            // a higher priority when retrieving them from the registry.
            // ComponentRegistry.Get<T> will fetch the most recently registered
            // implementation of a component type.
            // GetAll<T> will fetch all implementations in an IEnumerable<T>
            var consoles = registry.GetAll<IConsole>();
            var myConsole = registry.Get<IConsole>();

            // After retreiving a component implementation from the ComponentRegistry,
            // this line demonstrates calling a method declared in the IConsole interface.
            // The implementation is up to the component in the plugin.
            // The plugin component implementation will be fully debuggable as long as
            // the source and debugging symbols are present in the IDE.
            // For example, if the source files for the plugin project are part of the solution
            // in Visual Studio, a developer will be able to step into this call and debug
            // the code in the component implementation
            myConsole.WriteLine("Hello, World");
        }
    }
}
```

`Iridium.PluginEngine` is built on a lower level library, [Iridium.PluginCore](https://github.com/0xFireball/Iridium.PluginCore), which
provides classes for dynamically loading code and plugins at runtime. The PluginEngine abstracts and extends plugin loading, providing
a built-in service locator for registering default and custom plugin implementations. Types loaded in plugins can override existing functionality in core libraries, making your application modular and extensible even without the original source code or recompiling the program.
